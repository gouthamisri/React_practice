<p>The present day Himachal Pradesh has been inhabited since pre-historic times having witnessed multiple waves of human migration from other areas.[11] Through its history, the region was mostly ruled by local kingdoms some of which accepted suzerainty of larger empires. Prior to India's independence from the British, Himachal comprised the hilly regions of Punjab Province of British India. After independence, many of the hilly territories were organized as the Chief Commissioner's province of Himachal Pradesh which later became a union territory. In 1966, hilly areas of neighboring Punjab state were merged into Himachal and it was ultimately granted full statehood in 1971.</p>

<p>Himachal Pradesh is spread across valleys with many perennial rivers flowing through them. Almost 90% of the state's population lives in rural areas. Agriculture, horticulture, hydropower and tourism are important constituents of the state's economy. The hilly state is almost universally electrified with 99.5% of the households having electricity as of 2016. The state was declared India's second open-defecation-free state in 2016.[12] According to a survey of CMS – India Corruption Study 2017, Himachal Pradesh is India's least corrupt state</p>

<p>The history of Agra before the Islamic conquerors is unclear. A 17th century chronicle called it an old settlement which was merely a village, owing to its destruction by Mahmud of Ghazni, before Sikandar made it his capital.[9] The 11th-century Persian poet Mas'ūd Sa'd Salmān writes of an assault on the fortress of Agra, then held by the King Jaypal, by Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni. Despite his surrender, Mahmud sacked the place.[10] It was mentioned for the first time in 1080 AD when a Ghaznavide force captured it. Sultan Sikandar Lodī (1488–1517) was the first to move his capital from Delhi to Agra in 1506. He governed the country from here and Agra assumed the importance of the second capital.</p>

He was assigned to various posts and became the consultant of two sultans, Murat IV (1623–1640) and İbrahim (1640–1648). He prepared a series of reports (Turkish: Risale) about reforms in the empire. He presented his first report to Murat IV in 1631, and the second to Ibrahim in 1640.[1] Although the literary style of the first was more elaborate than the second, the main points were the same. In his reports he emphasized that the cause of unrest in the empire was the corruption of the timar (fief) system. He suggested a smaller and more disciplined army and a more authoritarian leadership.</p>
